# Tufin Backup Wizard (v. 1.7.6)
Automating backups for Tufin Orchestration Suite as well as automatically cleaning up older backups from your backup storage is not a builtin feature in Tufin. This appliaction has been developed to make your life easier and solve some of the most common backup requirements of Tufin customers. The Tufin Backups Wizard is a script that enables you to easily realize the backup you intended. You can setup local Tufin backups as well as backups that get saved to remote servers via FTP and SCP.

When the appliaction is run for the first time it will guide you through the setup process. After the initial setup has been completed, you can create a cronjob that will run the script periodically and by that create your automated local or remote Tufin backups.

# Tufin Backup Wizard Capabilities
- Create local Tufin backups (create and save backups on your Tufin server)
- Define prefixes for your backup files (usefull if many Tufin servers create backup files within the same directory)
- Automatically delete older backups within your local storage (the script will not remove any files on remote servers)
- Create remote Tufin backups via FTP
- Create remote Tufin backups via SCP

# Prerequisites
A Tufin installation containing TufinOS with TOS (Tufin Orchestration Suite) installed is required. For remote backups make sure that the user has the required permissions to store data on a remote server.

# Quickstart
Simply download the latet copy of the backup wizard and place the file called **backup-wizard.sh** on your Tufin Server:
1. Download the latest copy of **backup-wizard.sh**
2. Place it in the following directory on your Tufin Server: **/usr/local/bin/**
3. Make sure to set the correct owner of the script: **chown root:root /usr/local/bin/backup-wizard.sh**
4. Also make sure to set the correct permissions: **chmod 750 /usr/local/bin/backup-wizard.sh**
5. **Finally:** Run the wizard and follow the instructions: **sh /usr/local/bin/backup-wizard.sh**

**Note:** The wizard will create a configuration file after everything was setup initially. The configuration file is located at /usr/local/bin/backup-wizard.cfg by default (can be changed within **backup-wizard.sh**) and is only readable by the root-user.

**Also Note:** Passwords for remote backups will also stored within this file. Once a configuration file exists, the wizard will not be shown again and rerunning the file triggers the backup with the previously defined bnackup settings.
